# CryptKeeper
## This program is intended for encryption and decryption, including brute force attacks.

The bigint functions use the Boost Multiprecision library. The Boost Math package can be installed by
`sudo apt install libboost-math-dev` with the apt package manager, so you don't need the entire libboosts-all-dev package.
The [complete package can be downloaded](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_81_0.html) and extracted. The suggested version is 1.81 which contains the necessary libraries.
