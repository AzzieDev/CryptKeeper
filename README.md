# Cryptkeeper
## This program is intended for encryption and decryption, including brute force attacks.

The bigint functions use the Boost Multiprecision library. The Boost Math package can be installed by
`sudo apt install libboost-math-dev` with the apt package manager, so you don't need the entire libboots-all-dev package.

### Modes:
* Help menu
* Shift/Caesar Cipher
* Euclidean Algorithm (and Extended)
* Modular Exponentiation (PowerMod)
